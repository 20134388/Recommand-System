Task: Predict the rating scores of the pairs (u, i) in the Test.txt file. 
Datasetï¼š 
(1)	Train.txt, which is used for training your models. 
(2)	Test.txt, which is used for test. 
(3)	ItemAttribute.txt, which is used for training your models (optional). 
(4) ResultForm.txt, which is the form of your result file. 
The formats of datasets are explained in the DataFormatExplanation.txt. 
Note that if you can use ItemAttribute.txt appropriately and improve the performance of the algorithms, additional points (up to 10) can be added to your final course score. 

In this project, you need to report the predicted rating scores of the unknown pairs (u, i) in the Test.txt file. You can use any algorithms you have learned from the course or from other resources (such as MOOC).
